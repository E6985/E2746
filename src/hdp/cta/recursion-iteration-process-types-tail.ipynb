    "- specific type of linear recursion - method that makes a single call to itself but note it is at the very last operation in the method - is a single recursive call - everytime the method is invoked the methods activation frame or record will be placed on top of the program stack - want to avoid - there are multiple active stack frames which are unnecessary because they have finished their work in tail recursion - ok to use but can be expensive and inefficient - end up with all these activation frame records still taking up space on the stack even though they have actually completed their work/task and it is right at the end of the method - use sparingly and carefully [6]"
