    "- iteration allows some sequence of steps - block of code - to be executed repeatedly - for loop - while loop - recursion is another technique which may be applied to complete tasks which are repetitive in nature - recursion in many cases is an alternative to iteration - any set of tasks which many be accomplished using a recursive procedure may also be accomplished by using an iterative procedure/algorithm\n",

    "- recursion is an expensive way in designing an algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the expense lies in the fact there are multiple activation frames active for the method at any one point\n",

    "- if both true - if any task that can be accomplished in a recursive fashion could also be accomplished using iteration - given it is expensive and involves additional overhead when compared to an iterative approach - the use case of recursion - the extra expense - extra complexity ie running time - recursion is far outweighed by a simpler cleaner algorithm which leads to an implementation that is in general easier to code\n",
    "\n",
    "- making sacrifices in terms of the overhead involved with method calls etc - if the code can be cleaner - far more concise - is simplier and easier to understand - recursive calls happen in real life situations where recursion would occur and end up the natural solution to a problem - ultimately the recursion is eliminated when the compiler creates assembly language by implementing the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "- in general if the recursion tree - recursion process - has a simple form with a lot of repeated tasks then the iterative version may be in fact better\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the recursion tree appears quite - bushy - ie - a lot of different cases and a lot of different branches with which the task can do - with very few duplicate tasks - tasks that are very similar but different instances of the same problem - then recursion is likely the natural solution [6]"
