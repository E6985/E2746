    "- as well as the size - n - of the input - the characteristics of the data in the input set may also have an effect on the time which an algorithm takes to run - there could be many instances of size - n - which would be valid as input - it may be possible to group these instances into classes with broadly similar features - some algorithm - a - may be most efficient overall when solving a given problem - however it is possible that another algorithm - b - may in fact outperform - a - when solving particular instances of the same problem - conclusion to draw is that for many problems no single algorithm exists which is **optimal** for every possible input - therefore choosing an algorithm depends on **understanding** the **problem** being solved and the underlying probability distribution of the instances likely to be treated as well as the behaviour of the algorithms being considered [7] - by knowing the performance of an algorithm - can judge whether an algorithm is appropriate to use in the specific situation [8]"
