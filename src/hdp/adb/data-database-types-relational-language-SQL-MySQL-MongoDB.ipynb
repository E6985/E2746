    "- mongdb - better to use when the amount of data to be stored is enormous or when data can increase in a relatively short period of time - if the data to be stored is not in a consistent structure or is consistently changing - mongodb - preferable to - mysql - mongodb - can use document referencing and embedding - albeit does not have the strict foreign key constraints available in - mysql - may be a problem in some scenarios - double entry accounting - need to ensure a value put into a record actually exists in the database - mysql - very stable based on technology around for decades - if the data to be stored is very structured and controlled then - mysql - better option - using data types and foreign keys can ensure data integrity - in environments where data security and integrity is important then - mysql - is a better option [7]"
